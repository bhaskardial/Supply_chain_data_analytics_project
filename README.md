# Supply_chain_data_analytics_project

## Overview
XYZ Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer based in Gujarat, India, is facing challenges with customer retention due to issues in their supply chain delivery services. Some key customers did not renew their annual contracts, likely because of delays in product deliveries or incomplete shipments. As XYZ Mart plans to expand into new cities, it is crucial to address these issues by closely monitoring their service levels.

This project focuses on developing a dynamic dashboard that tracks and analyzes the supply chain’s ‘On-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’, and ‘OnTime In Full (OTIF) %’ metrics for all customer orders. By providing these insights daily, the supply chain team can quickly identify and resolve service level issues, ensuring better customer satisfaction and supporting XYZ Mart’s expansion goals.

## Problem Statement
XYZ Mart is operational in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara, with plans to expand to additional metros and Tier 1 cities within the next two years. However, a few key customers did not renew their annual contracts, likely due to poor service levels. The management suspects that these issues stem from products not being delivered on time or in full.

The supply chain analytics team has been tasked with tracking the ‘On-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’, and ‘OnTime In Full (OTIF) %’ metrics daily for all customers, against their target service levels. The goal is to identify and resolve service level issues swiftly, ensuring better customer satisfaction and supporting XYZ Mart’s expansion plans.

## Project Tasks

### Metric Calculation:

### Data Transformation:

Utilized Power Query to clean and transform the raw supply chain data, ensuring it was structured correctly for analysis and dashboard creation.

### Dashboard Creation:

Created a dynamic dashboard in Power BI according to stakeholder requirements, visualizing key metrics to track service levels on a daily basis.
Ensured that the dashboard is interactive and allows for easy drill-downs into specific customer or product issues.
